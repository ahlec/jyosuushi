### v2.1.0

New Features:

- **Improved question generation.** An attempt was made to focus more on the core numbers (1-10) and anything irregular or unexpected, and less on 42, 44, 45, 49 for every question.
- **Reduced the number of questions per counter.** It was... very high. Now it's less high.
- **Added release notes!** You'll see what changed when you load the page!

Bug Fixes:

- [Safari] Fixed a bug where the header would not fully transition.
- [Safari] Fixed a bug where the tutorial had the text rendering on top of images.
- [Firefox] Fixed a bug where the furigana were floating off to the side of the kanji.
- Switched to using Google Forms to address issues with previous bug report/submission box.
