        <p>
          The most common items for this counter are long, skinny objects. These
          can be in many forms: bottles, pens, trees, walking canes,
          architectural columns, kitchen knives. Buildings counted with{" "}

          </ruby>

          more (1:2, width-to-length) will usually be counted with{" "}

          counters.

          on thin boards of wood or bamboo that were bound together with cord.

          Over time, this generalization that the character 本 referred to

          (Chinese-style) readings for the numbers, you'll need to be careful as
          certain number-counter combinations contain sound changes; 「ほ」 will
          become 「ぼ」 or even 「ぽ」 depending on the number affixed to it.
          Luckily, this pattern of sound change is seen with many other counters
          as well, and once learned, the pattern can be expected. See the chart

          a specific image to listeners when it is used. For example, buildings
          can be counted with a number of other counters, such as{" "}
