      While 人 is the counter for humans and 匹 is the counter for animals, the
      line can sometimes be blurred. Non-human animals can be counted with 人,
      either out of respect or love; using 人 to count an animal will humanize
      the animal. Conversely, humans can be counted with 匹 to emphasize
      animalistic behaviour; a woman counted with 匹 would carry the nuance of
      being more beast than man.
