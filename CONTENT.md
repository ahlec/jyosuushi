## Counters Notes

Notes for a particular counter should contain the following sections:

- **Lead**. 1-2 sentence lead in. Super high-level summary of what this counter is/what it counts. Someone looking to know what 校 counts should be able to read these sentences and understand. If they want details or clarification (important -- no clarification here, too wordy) they should continue reading.
- **Definition**. Brief summary of what the dictionary says about this counter. This can be as short as "According to Daijisen, this counter is used to count people."
  - Always try to quote the name of the dictionary (give credit). Every definition should drop the name of at least one dictionary.
  - The first time mentioning a dictionary (eg, the first time you write Daijisen), you should make it a link to a website where someone can read that dictionary entry legally (eg https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/)
  - Multiple dictionaries are okay! In fact, it's encouraged. If two or more dictionaries don't say the same thing, odds are they provide some additional piece of information that'd be good to capture.
  - Make sure that you're not just restating the dictionary entry (mainly for legality reasons).
  - **DON'T** just focus on the 助数詞 section of the entry. Make sure to bring in the other parts of the entry as well. For instance, only focusing on the 助数詞 part of 校 completely omits the fact that 校 ideographically refers to schools and only talks about being used for literary proofs.
- **What it's meant to count**. If the definition section is seen as "Entry A + Entry B + Entry C" this should be seen as the equal sign in the equation. This is where you talk high-level about what can be counted. Don't enumerate everything, but take it a bit further than the base dictionary definition.
  - For example, the dictionary definition section for 校 might just say "As a noun, this refers to schools; as a counter, this is used to count literary proofs." Here is where you'd take it a step further and say "As a counter, this would be used to count educational institutions -- universities, public schools, academies, etc."
  - Also, if there's something that this counts that _isn't_ in the dictionary (either it's colloquial, or whatever), **make sure to highlight that** here.
- **Nuance**. What choosing this counter over other, similar counters can carry as an informational payload. This will coincide pretty closely with the disambiguations, but unlike that section this is meant to speak more broadly. For instance, when talking about 匹 you could say "Using 匹 for horses or giant dogs is grammatically valid, but because 頭 exists to cover them specifically, without already seeing the animal most speakers will imagine a smaller animal for 匹. Additionally, 匹 can rarely be used to describe humans. It's not a good thing (and not recommended) because it highlights them as being more beast than man."
  - A good way to think about this section is like "what's a high-level summary of every individual disambiguation melded together?"
  - Don't be afraid to duplicate information here.

In general:

- Try to let your sections have voice, but don't make them personal. Be lighthearted and maybe a little jovial, but don't use first-person language or tell anecdotes.
- The shorter, the better. **DON'T** cut words for the sake of cutting words, but also don't write something in 30 words that could be 10.
