### Dictionary Entries

The dictionary entries use a special, extended form of Markdown unique to the program. In addition to all of the regular markdown syntax typically available, the following items also exist specific to dictionary use:

#### Numerical Section Groups

Syntax: `{1} Noun.` or `{2} [Suffix] Counter. Used to count books.`

Dictionary sections will group entries into sections, usually based on the usage of the word (eg, noun, suffix, verb, etc). Usually these will even be numbered. Wrapping that number in curly braces will group everything after it (until the next numerical section or the end of the document) beneath it, and produce a header element with all of the text following on that same line with a number preceding it.

#### Examples

Syntax: `<"Our school">` or `<"We all went for a run.">`

Dictionary entries will almost always come with an example of the world being used in that particular way, often for each individual line in the entry itself. By wrapping it in angle brackets, we can distinguish examples from the rest of the definition for the purpose of formatting.

#### Footnotes

Syntax:

    Used to count proofs[^1].

    [^1]: As in the proofreading, physical paper to trial being printed sense.

Sometimes dictionary entries will wind up being vague or require more context. To preserve the translation as best but also still retain the context, translator notes should be included as footnotes.
